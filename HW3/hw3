                                Assignment - 3


I used the code from below sites as reference for my program

In order to compile I have installed libssl first:
	$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

I used the following commands:

server:
./pbproxy.o -l 1234 -k mykey localhost 4444

client:

./pbproxy.o  -k mykey localhost 1234

netcat:


nc -l -p 4444

The output is visible on netcat.

Execution through ssh
The setup command looks like as following:
    -   
    ./pbproxy -l 1234 -k mykey 127.0.0.1 22
      
    
    By setting the key string of "mykey" and the ip address and port number of sshd server, it will completely proxy the server flow.

 client-mode:

    
    ssh -o "ProxyCommand /home/shravya/Desktop/hw3/pbproxy -k mykey 127.0.0.1 1234" localhost
    -------------------------------------------------------    

I am able to perform remote login and below is the output of ssh command:
    shravya@localhost's password:

As command shown above, we should use the ABSOLUTE path of pbproxy instead of relative one. Then "-k" must combine with the same key "mykey" as defined in server-side.


On the pbproxy server side, code will setup 2 threads to handle the flows of "proxy client to sshd" and "sshd to proxy client" respectively.
On the pbproxy client side, it will also setup 2 threads to handle the flows of incoming and outcoming to the proxy server.


In this AES encryption is in CTR mode. It creates a randomly new IV only once for each TCP connection at the beginning of connection-setup, by using "RAND_bytes" library function.

I implementing multithreading and AES encryption.
